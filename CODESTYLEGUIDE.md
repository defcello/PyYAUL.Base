Uniform code styling is vital to good, maintainable code!  I have my own minute rules that I follow,
but these are the big ones.

# Indentation
4 spaces.  NO TABS!  I'm more fond of 2 spaces, but since this is public-facing I'm going to stick
with 4.

# Max Width
100 chars.

# Code documentation.
Sphinx for generating API documentation.  Examples available at
"https://pythonhosted.org/an_example_pypi_project/sphinx.html".
